<h1>Investigation of a Movie DataSet</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
This is a detailed analysis of a tmdb dataset of over 10,000 movies over a period of 1960 to 2015. Details of the movies were given including their popularity, revenue, budgets, the movie genres etc.
Research Questions were drawn and the dataset was wrangled and explored to answer the Questions to a good depth. Analysis were made and datas were also further cleaned for easy exploratory analysis

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<h3>The conclusion drawn after wrangling and exploratory analysis are as follows:</h3>
1. Movies released in recent times have a higher average popularity, the recent a movie is, the higher the average popularity
2. Animation movies have been found to be more lucrative in the 21st century (year 2000 and beyond)
3. Avatar made the highest profit in the 21st century and The warrior's way made the lowest profit
4. Our analysis showed some movies made losses as the revenue was lesser than the budget
5. Movies with higher runtime enjoyed high popularity when compared to movies with lower runtime
6. There is a strong correlation in movies with runtime ranging from 80 minutes to 130 minutes
7. There is a positive correlation between revenue and profit, movies with higher revenue tends to make more profits.
8. Limitations

  
This conclusion is not void of limitations and the limitations are as follows:

> We have some details that were missing which reduced our sample size
> Budgets and revenues of some movies were zero which is almost impossible realistically and dropping them reduced our sample size
> This conclusion is not totally void of error
